#   DISCONTINUED DO NOT USE THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!
I released a alpha/beta version of this script and it ended up bricking my FireStick 2nd gen tank permanently i do not have another one to continue development nor the money to waste if it bricks again. Please do not use this script at all if you do i am not responsible for any damage done to your FireStick or any device!!

I have also since removed the link to XDA for any of the required files for this script to work at all without the files this script is usless and harmless.

# Firestick-Tank-Restore
Install stock recovery and factory restore Amazon Firestick(Tank)

This script will only work on the codename tank firestick as its the only firestick i have to work on if you want more supported devices you will need to donate a device or work closly with me and understand bash scripting and android iner workings as well.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES THIS DOES TO YOUR DEVICE YOU USE AND RUN THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK AS IT IS MODDIFYING SYSTEM FILES ON YOUR FIRESTICK. IF THIS SCRIPT BRICKS YOUR DEVICE PLEASE RUN THE TWRP/ROOT EXPLOIT ON XDA TO UNBRICK YOUR FIRESTICK(Tank only) AND TRY AGAIN.

What does this script do:
So if you have a Firestick 2nd gen codenamed Tank and have installed a custom recovery and rooted the device but would like to return to stock software with officail updates from Amazon. Then this is the script for you if you try to update with TWRP installed via updates in settings it will fail since the stock recovery is missing. This script was designed to flash the stock recovery.img to your firestick and flash the update.zip to your cache partition. Returning the device to stock software with no root and no twrp so now you can ounce again get updates from Amazon as if it was new. Note this script does not factory reset your device at all but after running this script it is recommended that you factory reset to prevent any issues with updates in the future.

Important Instructions:
This script is just a script by its self for this script to work properly you will need to provide the official amazon update.bin file that contains both the update.zip file and the recovery.img as well. 

If you have the update.bin file you will need to rename the file to update.zip and then inside the zip file locate the official recovery as well and rename it to recovery.img.

For instruction on this script with all the needed files included please visit this XDA post.
